1) My interest in coding was started when I was studying 11th standard.
2) I started learning pygame out of my interest and explored a lot in that.
3) I started to learn c++ for arduino during my 12th standard.
4) I found coding so interesting and fun.
5) If i didn't get the correct output for the code, I would sit till I get the correct output.
6) The thought of how the devices work with the backend codes always fascinates me.
